# Racers (RACE) Token
CA: 0x659b968602be9a9386f9d0eafc34aca4effdfad1

Racers (RACE) is an Optimism-based token designed for Velodrome liquidity providers. Our mission is to create a reliable token pair with VELO, for the full realization of the flywheel effect within the Velodrome protocol.

## Tokenomics

- **Total Supply**: 3,203,578
- **Bribes**: The vast majority of the supply will be utilized for bribing the RACE/VELO guage, as more users provide liquidity the # of tokens bribed will decrease, but the $ amount will increase.
- **Liquidity**: 5% of the supply will be allocated to liquidity, with flexibility for adjustments to prevent dilution to holders. 
- **Airdrops**: 1% of the RACE supply will be airdropped, distributed gradually over several months. The criteria for receiving airdrops will be determined based on benefiting the Racers community.
- **Governance**: RACE tokens will also play a pivotal role in protocol governance, allowing holders to influence decisions that shape the future of RACE.
- **Team***: Zero. This is a community based token, team allocation does not and will not exist. 

## Velodrome

RACE/VELO = a love affair between two tokens.

- **veVELO Position**: We will diligently build a veVELO position using emissions from the original LP, strictly voting for the RACE/VELO gauge.
- **Recycled Bribes**: Recouped RACE tokens will be reinvested in the liquidity pool (up to 5% of the total supply) and/or re-used for the following epoch bribes.


## Governance

A snapshot.org link will be made available soon, allowing holders to participate in governance decisions.
